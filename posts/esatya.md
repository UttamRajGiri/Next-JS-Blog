Digital assets, sometimes called tokens, are poorly understood. Here's an outline of digital assets based on the book - Blockchain Revolution and Blockchain Research Institute Taxonomy of Cryptoassets.

1. Cryptocurrencies
The native cryptographic asset of a particular blockchain protocol, designed and intended to 'serve as a general-purpose store of value or medium of exchange.' Eg, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Z-cash

2. Protocol/Utility Token
Utility tokens are intended to provide digital access to an application or service. After the application is completed, utility tokens may give holders perks such as access to the network or voting rights. Eg, Gas cost - Ethereum in DApps

3. Security Token
Physical assets represented in digital form i,e, backed up by tangible assets. This allows for an investor to have ‘fractional’ ownership of an underlying asset. Eg, Land, Shares, Stocks tokenize
